Hey everyone, my name is Liam, also known as ruuffian. I have a Bachelors in Math and Computer Science from Temple University who doesn't know what to do after deciding not to go to grad school. If you're a recruiter, message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-mackay/)! 

If you want to talk about programming or anything at all, hit me up on Discord @ruuffian or at my email ruuffian@gmail.com.
