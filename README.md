Hey everyone, my name is Liam, also known as ruuffian. I'm a Math and Computer Science major at Temple University who doesn't know what to do after deciding not to go to grad school. If you're a recruiter, message me on (LinkedIn)[https://www.linkedin.com/in/liam-mackay/]! 

If you want to talk about programming or anything at all, hit me up on Discord @ruuffian#2919 or at my email ruuffian@gmail.com.
